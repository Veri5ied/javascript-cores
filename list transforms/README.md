# List Transforms

Loop through all the properties of the suspect objects in the suspects array, mark them if you think they are guilty.

```
const game = {
    "suspects": [
        {
            name: "Alvin",
            color: "blue"
        },
        {
            name: "Patrick",
            color: "red"
        }
    ]
}
```
